              <p>We are committed to safeguarding your privacy. This policy applies to all products built and maintained by FocusPledge LLC including the mobile app:&nbsp;Logoff&nbsp;(all versions), previously named FocusPledge, the website: www.focuspledge.com, www.logoffapp.com, and related offerings and services.<br><br>When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, "I", or “us” in this document, we are referring to FocusPledge LLC.<br><br>In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.<br><br>This policy applies to our handling of information about site visitors, prospective customers, and customers and authorized users (in relation to their procurement of the services and management of their relationship with FocusPledge LLC). We refer collectively to these categories of individuals as "you" throughout this policy.</p>
              
              <h2>What we collect and why</h2>
              <p><strong>Identity and access</strong><br>When you sign up for any of our products, we ask for identifying information such as your name and email address. That's so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you product updates and other essential information. We may also send you optional surveys from time to time to help us understand how you use our products and to make improvements. <br><br>With your consent, we will send you our newsletter and other updates. We sometimes also give you the option to add a profile picture that displays in our products.<br><br>We'll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won't use your name in marketing statements without your permission either.<br><br><strong>Billing information</strong><br>If you purchase our product, you will be asked to provide your payment information and billing address. Credit card information is submitted directly to our payment processor and doesn't hit our servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for purposes of account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address so we can charge you for service, calculate any sales tax due, send you invoices, and detect fraudulent credit card transactions. We occasionally use aggregate billing information to guide our marketing efforts.<br><br><strong>Product interactions</strong><br>We store on our servers the content that you upload or receive or maintain in any of our products. This is so you can use our products as intended, for example, custom block lists in Logoff. We keep this content as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we'll delete the content within 60 days.<br><br><strong>General Geolocation data<br>‍</strong>For most of our products, we log the full IP address used to sign up a product account and retain that for use in mitigating future spammy signups. We also log all account access by full IP address for security and fraud prevention purposes, and we keep this login data for as long as your product account is active.<br><br><strong>Website interactions</strong><br>We collect information about your browsing activity for analytics and statistical purposes such as conversion rate testing and experimenting with new product designs. This includes, for example, your browser and operating system versions, your IP address, which web pages you visited and how long they took to load, and which website referred you to us. If you have an account and are signed in, these web analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account until your account is no longer active. The web analytics we use are described further in the Advertising and Cookies section.<br><br><strong>Anti-bot assessments</strong><br>We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> across our applications to mitigate brute force logins and as a means of spam protection. We have a legitimate interest in protecting our apps and the broader Internet community from credential stuffing attacks and spam. When you log into an account and when you fill in certain forms on our website, the CAPTCHA service evaluates various information (e.g., IP address, how long the visitor has been on the app, mouse movements) to try to detect if the activity is from an automated program instead of a human. The CAPTCHA service then provides us with the spam score results; we do not have access to the evaluated information.<br><br><strong>Advertising and Cookies</strong><br>We runs contextual ads on various third-party platforms such as Google, Reddit, Apple, and Meta. Users who click on one of our ads will be sent to our marketing site. Where permissible under law, we may load an ad-company script on their browsers that sets a third-party cookie and sends information to the ad network to enable evaluation of the effectiveness of our ads, e.g., which ad they clicked and which keyword triggered the ad, and whether they performed certain actions such as clicking a button or submitting a form.<br><br>We also use persistent first-party cookies and some third-party cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our applications, and perform A/B testing as well as support some analytics.<br><br>A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help remember login information and site preferences. It might also collect information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages visited, duration of visit, content viewed, and other click-stream data. You can adjust cookie retention settings and accept or block individual cookies in your browser settings, although our apps won't work and other aspects of our service may not function properly if you turn cookies off.<br><br><strong>Voluntary correspondence</strong><br>When you email us with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including your email address, so that we have a history of past correspondence to reference if you reach out in the future.<br><br>We also store information you may volunteer, for example, written responses to surveys. If you agree to a customer interview, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We will only do so with your express consent.<br><br><strong>How we approach mobile app permissions</strong><br>Because of how the platforms are designed, our apps typically must request your consent before accessing contacts, calendar, camera, and other privacy-sensitive features of your device. Consent is always optional, though some features may be unavailable.</p>
              
              <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
              <p><strong>To provide products or services you've requested</strong>. We use some third-party subprocessors to help run our applications and provide the Services to you. We also use third-party processors for other business functions such as managing newsletter subscriptions, sending customer surveys, and providing our company storefront.<br><br>Third parties we currently use include:<br>- WebFlow.com<br>- Kit.com<br>- Google Analytics<br><br>None of our humans look at your content except for limited purposes with your express permission, for example, if an error occurs that stops an automated process from working and requires manual intervention to fix.<br><br>These are rare cases, and when they happen, we look for root cause solutions as much as possible to avoid them recurring. We may also access your data if required in order to respond to legal process.<br><br><strong>To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug</strong>, with your permission. If at any point we need to access your content to help you with a support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.<br><br><strong>Aggregated and de-identified data.</strong> We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the services. We may use de-identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including marketing or analytics.<br><br><strong>When required under applicable law.</strong> FocusPledge LLC is a U.S. based company and all data infrastructure are located in the U.S.</p>
              <ul><li><strong>Requests for user data</strong>. Our policy is to not respond to government requests for user data unless we are compelled by legal process or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. However, if U.S. law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us to disclose data, we must comply. Likewise, we will only respond to requests from government authorities outside the U.S. if compelled by the U.S. government through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. It is our policy to notify affected users before we disclose data unless we are legally prohibited from doing so, and except in some emergency cases.</li><li>If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to disclose billing-related information. If that happens, we will disclose only the minimum needed, such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.</li></ul>
              <p>Finally, if our product is acquired by or merges with another company — we don't plan on that, but if it happens — we'll notify you well before any of your personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
              
              <h2>User Rights</h2>
              <p>We strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Some of these rights include:</p>
              <ul><li><strong>Right to Know.</strong> You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.</li><li><strong>Right of Access.</strong> This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.</li><li><strong>Right to Correction.</strong> You have the right to request correction of your personal information.</li><li><strong>Right to Erasure / “To Be Forgotten”.</strong> This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, from all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using our services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.</li><li><strong>Right to Complain.</strong> You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.</li><li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing.</strong> This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of your personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)</li><li><strong>Right to Object.</strong> You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.</li><li><strong>Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making.</strong> You have the right to object to and prevent any decision that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.</li><li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination.</strong> We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.</li></ul>
              <h2>Data Security</h2>
              <p>When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.<br><br>Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security.</p>
              
              <h2>What happens when you delete content in your product accounts</h2>
              <p>In many of our applications, we give you the option to trash content. Trashed content cannot be accessed via the application and we are not able to retrieve it for you. The trashed content may remain on our active servers for another 30 days, and copies of the content may be held in backups of our application databases for up to another 30 days after that. Altogether, any content trashed in your product accounts should be purged from all of our systems and logs within 90 days.<br><br>If you choose to cancel your account, your content will become immediately inaccessible and should be purged from our systems in full within 60 days. </p>
              
              <h2>Data retention</h2>
              <p>We keep your information for the time necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and your choices, after which time we may delete and/or aggregate it. We may also retain and use this information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Through this policy, we have provided specific retention periods for certain types of information.</p>
              
              <h2>Location of site and data</h2>
              <p>Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, UK, or elsewhere outside of the United States, <strong>please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States</strong>. By using our websites or Services and/or providing us with your personal information, you consent to this transfer.</p>
              
              <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
              <p>We may update our privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on our website. If the changes are significant, we will communicate with you directly through the email associated with your account.</p>
